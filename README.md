## ✨ Features

SonosphereAI's Audio Toolkit is a **five-in-one** suite of tools, accessible via a seamless tab interface, to cover all your audio manipulation needs:

---

### 🎶 Melody to Lyrics
**Melody to Lyrics** | *AI-Powered Lyric Generation*
![Melody to Lyrics](frontend/static/images/melody_options.png)
This **new feature** allows you to upload an existing musical track (instrumental or with vocals). Our AI will analyze the melody and harmonic structure to generate original, matching lyrics based on your preferences. You can customize the **Lyric Style/Mood** (e.g., Pop), **Rhyme Scheme** (e.g., AABB), **Lyric Length** (e.g., Medium (5-10 lines)), and **Language** (e.g., English).



---

### 🎤 Lyrics to Melody (Instrumental)
**Lyrics to Melody** | *Instrumental Synthesis*
![Lyrics to Melody (Instrumental)](frontend/static/images/instr_opt.png)
This tool takes your written lyrics and synthesizes a corresponding melody and instrumental backing track. It essentially reverses the process, allowing your words to inspire the music. This aligns with your original **Vocals to Instrument Conversion** concept.



---

### 🎵 Lyrics to Melody (Vocal)
**Lyrics to Melody** | *Vocal Synthesis*
![Lyrics to Melody (Vocal)](frontend/static/images/vocal_options.png)
This section is dedicated to **vocal synthesis**, which takes your lyrics and generates the corresponding vocal track, complete with realistic pitch and performance characteristics. This aligns with your original **Advanced Instrument Options** and **MIDI-like Note Editing** concepts by focusing on fine-grained control over the generated vocal performance.



---

### 🎼 Melody Maker
**Melody Maker** | *Vocals & MIDI*

A comprehensive creative hub for constructing music. This combines the ability to input a melody to generate vocals with **MIDI-like note editing** capabilities for precise control over the musical score, including features like adjusting **Pitch Band** values.



---

### 🔇 Noise Reduction
**Noise Reduction** | *Spectral Masking*
